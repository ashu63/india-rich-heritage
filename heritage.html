                            <p>India has a beautiful culture, which astonishes tourists from other parts of the world.
                                It is not just because the culture is several thousands of years old. It is beautiful
                                because of its ability to be secular and at the same time stick to the essence of each
                                cultural group. India’s unique culture has led to several celebrations, traditions, and
                                customs.

                                Most of these customs have been rooted in texts and scriptures, which are older than
                                science and have been scientifically proved to be advantageous for mental and physical
                                health.</p>

                        <div class="culture__para">
                            <p>To welcome anyone, the locals do Namaste. Namaste is an act where the person would place
                                his hands palm-to-palm and raise it up to his chest and say ‘namaste’. It is translated
                                as ‘I bow to you’. Namaste was derived from Namaha, which means ‘not mine’, which
                                indicates that the person performing Namaste is reducing any presence of ego in his mind
                                to get to know the other person. Placing the hands parallel to the chest represents ‘May
                                our minds meet’.</p>

                        <div class="culture__para">
                            <p>Many religious celebrations involve fasting. Beyond those, many people skip a meal on a
                                specific day of a week, to pay gratitude to a God or a notion. Theologically speaking,
                                this is a way of showing God that you are ready to sacrifice your happiness for the
                                wellness of your family or for a better future. Depriving your body of necessity for a
                                short period of time shows your commitment. These fasting have become rules in many
                                celebrations too. When it comes to scientific reasoning, fasting promotes control and
                                regulation to our system. It promotes a healthy environment inside your body, where your
                                mind will have entire control over your body.</p>
